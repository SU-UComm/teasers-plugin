# Stanford Teaser

This plugin provides a `teaser` post type.
Teasers are intermixed with regular posts in post lists on

- the home page (if the home page is a list of posts vs. a static page)
- archive pages (date archives, category archives, tag archives)
- RSS feeds

Teasers in lists link directly to an off-site source, vs. the on-site instance of `teaser`.
